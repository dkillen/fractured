# Fractured
Fractured is a proof of concept project exploring fractional co-ownership of land using the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Legal Background
The way in which legal ownership of land is recorded and the transfer of interests in land takes place differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For that reason Fractured intentionally ignores the legal and regulatory issues relating to the ownership of and transfer of interests in land. However, some kind of framework is required to give context to the project. With that in mind, Fractured is developed with the Torrens Title system in mind as used in Australia.

### Torrens Title
The core of the Torrens Title system is the register. Fundamentally, the register records interests in land, including ownership. The register is the definitive record as to the ownership of land. The Torrens Title system allows for fractional co-ownership of land. In this case, the owners are known as tenants in common.

> #### Features of co-ownership as tenants in common
>
> 1. The interest in the land of each tenant in common is separate and distinct from the other.
> 2. The interest can be equal half shares each or any other shares (eg. it may be 1/3rd for one and 2/3rd for the other or it may be 1/100th for one and 99/100th for the other).
> 3. There can be several owners as tenants in common all with different shares.
> 4. All tenants in common are entitled to physical possession of the whole property.
> 5. Tenants in common can each deal with third parties as to their share as a separate owner, generally without the need for other co-owner's consent(unless they have a co-ownership agreement in place).
> 6. Tenants in common can acquire their interests at different times and from different people.
> 7. Each tenant in common is free to sell or otherwise deal with their interest in a property at anytime (unless there is in place a co-ownership agreement which contains terms restricting this).
